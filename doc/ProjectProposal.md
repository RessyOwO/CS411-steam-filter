# Project Proposal

## Describe what data is stored in the database. (Where is the data from, and what attributes and information would be stored?)
[Game data link](https://data.world/craigkelly/steam-game-data)
The database has information about different games including pricing, genres, specifications of the computer required, supported languages and numerous others. The data is from the doc “Project Track 1 Datasets” provided by the TA’s. It is from a website called data.world.
## What are the basic functions of your web application? (What can users of this website do? Which simple and complex features are there?)
- Game search (for users)
1. Can put in specs of computer (2- 4)
2.  Types of game (genre) (5+)
3. Price range (1)
4. Supported language (1)
- Users can upload review for certain games
			
## What would be a good creative component (function) that can improve the functionality of your application? (What is something cool that you want to include? How are you planning to achieve it?)
1. Visual on how many games are there in each genre
2. Visual on pricing for all games in certain genre
For our creative component, we make a way for the users to visualize comparisons between different genres by pricing, number of games and other qualities. We plan to achieve this through a filter system and then graphs to display the information in a way that the user can see the information for each genre.


## Project Title
SteamScanner
## Project Summary:  It should be a 1-2 paragraph description of what your project is.
Searching for a new game to play could be a tedious procedure on the Steam platform if they have rough ideas about the ideal next game in their minds such as the genre of the game, budget, etc. Our project aims to help the gamers to make their decisions more efficiently according to users’ own queries (multiple features), and users can upload their reviews on our webpage for other users’ reference as well. In addition, there might be some curious gamers who want to know some statistics of some games so we provide the visualization of the some statistics to help them better find what they want to play next.


## Description of an application of your choice. State as clearly as possible what you want to do. What problem do you want to solve, etc.?
We want to build an application that analyzes games in a way that it is easier for gamers to see what kind of games they would want to play. This application would also allow them to compare different genres of games and visualize the statistics of the different games. Users would also be able to help each other by being able to add reviews. For now, it is a pain searching for games on steam, because you are only allowed to input one feature. We want to save users the time and effort to search for the games they want by allowing users to search with multiple features.
## Usefulness. Explain as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful.  Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar websites/applications out there?  If so, what are they, and how is yours different?
While websites for gamers exist, the interface of our application will be more dynamic rather than simply readable. There will be more visualizations and filtration functionalities that allow the user to see comparisons between different games and aspects of games while getting all the information about useability and technical information. 


## Realness.  Describe what your data is and where you will get it.
Our dataset is called “Steam Game Data” and is a csv that consists of various information about different kinds of games, including but not limited to genre, reviews, and specs of the games. We obtained the data from https://data.world/craigkelly/steam-game-data, which is one of the datasets provided by TAs in CS411.


## Description of the functionality that your website offers. This is where you talk about what the website delivers. Talk about how a user would interact with the application (i.e., things that one could create, delete, update, or search for). Read the requirements for stages 4 and 5 to see what other functionalities you want to provide to the users. You should include:
A low-fidelity UI mockup: What do you imagine your final application’s interface might look like? A PowerPoint slide or a pencil sketch on a piece of paper works! <br>

## Project work distribution: Who would be responsible for each of the tasks or subtasks?
List of the person responsible for which exact functionalities in section 6. Explain how backend systems will be distributed across members. Be as specific as possible as this could be part of the final peer evaluation metrics.
